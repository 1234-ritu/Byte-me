#### A mental health monitor of Four modules
#### *1.MOOD TRACKER*
>It is used to detect the emotions of the user's face and displays the probability of 7 different emotions. It has the accuracy of 66%. And uses cv2, haarcascade_files,keras.For the dataset. The images have been converted to pixels and then used for training and testing.

#### *4.SCORE CHECKER*
>In this module, a student’s SGPA of all semesters (including backlogs) is taken as the input. Using this input, output is predicted on whether mental health support is needed
We trained and tested our Machine Learning model, using 40% of the dataset given as
a resource by HackMakers. As a result, the training accuracy is 87% and testing
accuracy is 82%
